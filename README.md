# Coding-Diary-Summer-2021
This is a collection of daily reflections from my time on School of Code bootcamp.

Day 1: 30 March 

**Today's progress:**

- Spent 1.5 hours on marksheet reading about HTML
- Was getting to grips with VS code and starting my first website

**Thoughts:**

- It's been really interesting learning about the computer science behind terms we use everyday and de-mystifying what it all means
- I feel VS code and I have a way to go before we understand each other but we'll get there.
- It's quite difficult to visually adjust to new programmes and grow familiar with coding font and interfaces.

Day 2: Apr 1

**Today's progress:**

- Did the first pair coding today with Lewis in the Wednesday session: really enjoy paired coding. It's really helpful to watch someone inputting, and sharing two brains becoming more familiar with the code.
- Edited my first website and expadning knowledge of HTML

**Thoughts:**

- It's interesting coding with someone whose at a different level of coding expereince. Simultaneously great to hear that knoweldge, and overwhelming as I try to complete a task I have no language for yet. 
- Still getting to grips with the process for VS code and git hub and the opening protocols

Day 3: Apr 5

**Today's progress:**

- Returned to tackle my avatar. Have managed to work out how to make glasses transparent(ish), and have reorganised the code in HTML and CSS and got rid of code that was redundant

- learnt markdown! Edited the read me file about what i've learnt. Having a bit of trouble with images so need to come back to that another day. still need to do [https://dev.to/](https://dev.to/) and add my days of code to this
- did the inspect tutorial
- did line commander

**Thoughts:**

- going forward I'm going to skip the reading and do the exercises. In this case i really learn by doing and being more familiar with the terms practically helps me place the meaning after i have read

Day 4: Apr 6

**Today's progress:**

- Researchered and created a basic client form for my partner to fill out some more aesthetic details for the look and layout of their website. Manged to push that up to our shared repository with no dramas.
- Began the basic layout of my website using [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp) to help. Will then edit the layout as more information arrives. Struggled to push it to the repositry

    **Today's Thoughts:**

    - Feeling great and finally on track. After a lot of not knowing and a bit of drowning at the deep end last week, feel like I'm slowly managing to swim a little
    - looking forward to the moment where i'll understand more and then can research more around the topics.

Day 5: Apr 7

**Today's Progress** 

- spent 6 hours coding. Absorbed as much as I could of HTML and CSS.
- Enjoyed line commander
- Applied that learning (along with a handy base layout from W3 schools) into my website! Woo

**Today's Thoughts**

- I'm finally starting to absorb the HTML Script. Still have some questions about CSS but am getting there.

Day 6: Apr 8 

**Today's Progress**

- Created a bit of client form for lewis to fill out. This was to help with creating the aesthetic and layout of the website
- Managed to push that up to git okay!

**Today's Thoughts**

- Intersting the questions to choose for client forms and what applies to now and what will apply to later. 
- My partner is very keen to limit the website to the very basic demands of the course for now. So am balancing my desire to learn more and do more, against the time we have available, and the desires of my partner. 

Day 7: Apr 9

**Today's Progress** 

- In class this week we looked into git hub, repositories and learnt how to insert branches into our work
- We also had a quick recap of what we'd learnt so far in terms of css and looking over webpages and code reviews

**Today's Thoughts**

- Feeling good. Glad we went over git and feeling more comfroatble with the error messages now

Day 8: Apr 10 

**Today's Progress**

- I made a git branch for my website and also invited my partner to a code review
- Read more into CSS today. Still trying to find what the bare bones of a CSS script might be, or the most essential CSS code to start a website

**Today's Thoughts**

- Making git branch went well and i was able to deconstruct the error code from any arising problems without panicking and solve them.
- Still trying to find what the bare bones of a CSS script might be, or the most essential CSS code to start a website

Day 9: Apr 11

**Today's Progress**

- I continued with the CSS stylistic elements of the profile.
- Managed to make a picture fit the background of the page footer to make a nice stylistic element as you scroll down.
- Did a code review of my partner's work for their profile on me.

**Today's Thoughts**

- I have a few questions about * and flex box on the CSS layout. I will come back to this later as I haven't done the reading to understand it yet.

Day 10: Apr 12

**Todays Progress**

- Today in class we went through the whole of Java Script
- After class, I spent 2 hours reading through the week 2 fundamentals. Cementing my understanding of HTML and CSS. I also did a lot of readin gon flex box and ALMOST completed flexbox froggy. That last question was a hard one.

**Today's Thoughts**

- Java script is cool. Got a lot of reading to understand it though.
- Flex-box is also cool. think i'm going to have to start everyday wiuth a game of flexbox froggy to understand it all.
- Computer science and coding is like learning another language like French or Mandarin. This phrase helps me not feel overwhelmed.

Day 11: Apr 17

**Today's Progress**

- Today I was working on Java Script and the Week 3, Exercise 1 looking at how to create java script for alert windows, favourite numbers, and the weather.
- I found the common mistake I was making was failing to define variables. I was making guesses at how I might set a variable before trialling it and then googling the bug.  was getting stuck on defining variables.

**Today's Thoughts**

- I have a basic grasp of conditional statements but think I need to work on my understanding of boolean statements and loops and differentiating between the two.

Day 12: Apr 18 

**Today's Progress**

- Attempted workshop 2 today the password checker
- First hurdle was I realised I hadn't linked the java and the html script.
- Now for steps 1 and 2 I made a script that worked. When it came to inserting the while and if statements I was struggling to create the syntax that counted the attempts and also broke the loop if the password was correct.
- I also tried to make a second version of steps 1 and 2 with a function element. I couldn't get this bit to work unfortunately.

**Today's Thoughts**

- I need to read more around the syntax for while loops and functions. Hopefully this will help me problem solve the next steps.

Day 13: June 6

**Today's Progress**
- Wk 11 repo was focused on UX and UI design
- Spent 4 hours this afternoon learning the difference between the two. 
- UX design is about designing the whole experience: focusing on how the user feels? their motivations? researching and testing and iterating this
- UI design is about designing the whole interface: everythign the user interacts with essentially providing a solution to the conceptual questions posed in UX design. 
- Both processes are intertwinned. Looked in the cycle of Design thinking and the creation of User personas
- I also created a git hub progress project to monitor my workflow with the repos, and as a way to reflect on what we've learnt. Re-vist things that have been forgotten or need brushing up on and as a way of the School of Code seeing my progress. 


**Today's Thoughts**
- I have gone over the allotted hours to try and rectify the balance and get myself into a good place to mangae the next stretch of the course. 
- I am keen to keep practicing my coding skills with free code camp and through code wars and hope that organising my time like this will help me fit in all the workflow.
